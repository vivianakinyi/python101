""" Write a program using a while loop that asks the user for a number, and prints a countdown from that number
to zero. What should your program do if the user inputs a negative number? As a programmer, you should
always consider 'edge conditions' like these when you program! (Another way to put it- always assume the
users of your program will be trying to find a way to break it! If you dont include a condition that catches
negative numbers, what will your program do?) """
